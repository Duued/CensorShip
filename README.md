# CensorShip
version2 of CensorShip


CensorShip is a discord bot, that will auto ban users when they say specific words

To see the bot, go to https://discord.gg/CyDDBpf 
Run `c!invite` to invite it to your server

Direct bot invite link: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=739125103505309747&permissions=126159&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2FCyDDBpf&response_type=code&scope=bot%20identify


Run `c!required_permissions` (`c!perms` is an alias)

The bot is still being activley worked on, so please let me patch bugs and stuff. (Only bugs I see are permission errors which isn't really a bug)

Thank you for supporting the development of CensorShip
